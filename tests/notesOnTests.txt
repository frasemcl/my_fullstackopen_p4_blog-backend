The following command only runs the tests found in the tests/note_api.test.js file:
npm test -- tests/blog_api.test.js

The -t option can be used for running tests with a specific name:
npm test -- -t 'a specific blog post title is within the returned post titles'

The provided parameter can refer to the name of the test or the describe block. The parameter can also contain just a part of the name. The following command will run all of the tests that contain blog in their name:
npm test -- -t 'blog'

When running a single test, the mongoose connection might stay open if no tests using the connection are run. The problem might be because supertest primes the connection, but Jest does not run the afterAll portion of the code.
